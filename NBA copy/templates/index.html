                <p>The 2018–19 NBA season was the 73rd season of the <a href="https://www.nba.com">National Basketball Association</a> NBA.
                    The regular season began on October 16, 2018, and ended on April 10, 2019</p>
                <p>The 2019 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NBA_All-Star_Game">NBA All-Star Game</a> was played on February 17, 2019, at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.
                     The playoffs began on April 13, 2019 and ended on June 13 with the <a href="https://www.nba.com/raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> defeating the defending
                      NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the 2019 NBA Finals, becoming NBA champions for the first time in franchise history. 
                      This season would mark the first time since 2010 in which LeBron James did not make a Finals appearance. 
                      This would also be the final season for Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and Dwyane Wade.

                  <p>The graphic below shows the flow of players between teams through the entirety of the 2018 - 2019 NBA season. Chords connect teams whose roster had duplicate players in the NBA roster dataset. The width of the chord is proportional to the number of players shared between the two groups.</p>
                  <p>
                    Mouse over a team’s name or “arc” in order to focus on only the chords attached to that team.

                  <p>
                    For example, mousing over the 2019 NBA championship-winning Raptors, we can see the deal with the Memphis Grizzlies that saw three players (C.J. Miles, Jonas Valančiūnas, and Delon Wright) leave TOR in exchange for Marc Gasol. </p>
